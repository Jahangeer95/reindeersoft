    "The Agile Software Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, where each iteration, typically lasting from two to four weeks, defines its duration, and scope in advance. Quality Assurance (QA) plays a vital role in this process, ensuring that the final software product meets high-quality standards. In Agile development, QA is seamlessly integrated into the development process, as opposed to being a separate stage. QA can seamlessly intertwine with the entire development lifecycle as:",
